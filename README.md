# YouTube-Trends

YouTube is the largest video sharing and hosting website nowadays. It has profoundly influenced peopleâ€™s daily life, including the way of receiving and sharing information on a worldwide scale. Therefore, analyzing YouTube dataset becomes significant for companies to get an insight into how social media trends have a significant impact on changing the traditional way of advertising commercial products or build a brand recognition through the embedded advertising in a new form in YouTube videos. With that, we can make a prediction, which will be used for mapping out the future strategic business planning and resource mobilization.

Our overall objectives are investors and advertisers. We will provide business recommendations for these two types of users, including which channels have more business value and what topics people are interested in now.
